# Discord-AI-Selfbot

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org)-based Discord selfbot using the `discord.py-self` library. The selfbot automatically responds to messages that uses it's trigger word using either ChatGPT or BARD and has image generation using an external endpoint, **all for completely free**. It functions as a normal Discord bot, just on a real Discord account, allowing other people to talk to it within DMs, servers and even group chats without you needing to invite a bot or add the bot to the server - making it seem like a real user to others.

This bot was originally [Discord-AI-Chatbot](https://github.com/mishalhossin/Discord-Chatbot-Gpt4Free/) by [MishalHossin](https://github.com/mishalhossin/) but was heavily edited by [Najmul190](https://github.com/najmul190) to work as a selfbot rather than a Discord bot.

### <strong> I take no responsibility for any actions taken against your account for using these selfbots, or how users use my open source code.</strong>

### <strong>Using this on a user account is prohibited by the [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and can lead to your account getting banned in very rare cases.</strong>

# How to talk to the bot

- To activate it in a channel use **~toggleactive** in the channel or manually add the channel ID in `channels.txt`
- To see all commands use **~help**
- Bear in mind that the bot will only respond to **other accounts** and not itself, including any commands.
- You must also set a trigger word within the `.env`, this is the word that the bot will respond to. For example, if you set the trigger word to `John`, people must say "Hey `John`, how are you today?" for the bot to respond.
